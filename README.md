# StringCalculator

My comment on this project : 

it was rather hard working this in a linux enviroment using VIM as my text editor assistance of IDE would have been greatly appreciated, I do understand why we would want to not use IDE all the time, especially as this is my first time doing java.  Scripts were changed and should be able to run on any enviroment. 
Not possible without huge assistance from my classmates and google.

I think I have grasped what TDD development is, in hindsight I would have wanted to commit more before doing refactoring in my enviroment.  But I guess you live and you learn!
